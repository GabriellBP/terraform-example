  Simple Terraform Example
</h2>

<p><b>Terraform</b> is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources, such as servers, databases, and networking components, using a high-level configuration language (HCL). Terraform can manage infrastructure across various cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud) as well as on-premises environments, making it a versatile tool for automating infrastructure management.

With Terraform, you can version your infrastructure, easily replicate environments, and use a declarative approach to define the desired state of your infrastructure, which Terraform then creates and maintains.</p>
